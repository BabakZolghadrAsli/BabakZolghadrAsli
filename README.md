## Hi there! I'm Babak ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a PhD researcher in hydroinformatics working jointly between the University of Queensland and the University of Exeter.  
My work focuses on leveraging computational intelligence (CI) and artificial intelligence (AI) to solve complex water-related and sustainability challenges.  
I'm especially passionate about open research, data-centric approaches, and developing practical tools that support climate resilience and the water-energy-food nexus.
